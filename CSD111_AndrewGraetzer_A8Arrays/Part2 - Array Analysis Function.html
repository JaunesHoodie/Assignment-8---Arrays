    Name: Andrew Graetzer
    Assignment (8): Part 2 - Array Analysis Function
    Description: : Write a function "countOccurences(numArray, num)" that takes an array
    of numbers and a number as a parameter

    - The function counts and returns a number of times a given number has been repeated in the array
    --- Ex: Given the array: var numbers = [1,1,5,6,2,11,1,8,0]. If we call the function "countOccurences(numbers, 1),"
    it will return 3, because 1 is repeated in the given array 3 times. ---
    - In the main script, create an array of numbers, call the function and print the result to the page.
    - Your output must be formatted as show: "The number of occurrences of 1 in [1,1,5,6,2,11,1,6,0] is 3"
