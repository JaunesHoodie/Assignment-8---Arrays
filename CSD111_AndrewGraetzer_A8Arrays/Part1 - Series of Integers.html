    Assignment (8): Part 1 - Series of Intergers
    Description: : Design and implement a program that asks the user to enter an arbitrary
    number of positive and negative intergers

    - Each time the user enters an interger the program asks whether the user wants to enter one more. (Store the intergers in the array).
    - Use a loop to output all the intergers stored in array in two groups: first output all negative intergers and their sum, then output
    all positive integers and their sum.
    --- Do not output 0 even if it is present in the array ---
   
    --- How the output should be:                                ---
    --- You entered the following negative integers: -4, -7, -1  ---
    --- The sum of all negative integers is: -12                 ---
    --- You entered the following positive integers: 1, 10, 3 ,5 ---
    --- The sum of all positive integers is: 19                  ---
